Getting and Cleaning Data
========================================================

Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project examining accelerometer data from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones

This R script creates a tidy dataset from the raw data available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To run the script:
1. Extract the above file, which should create a folder named UCI HAR Dataset
2. Run run_analysis.R, making sure to set your working directory to the directory contaning UCI HAR Dataset
3. Two text files will be created AccelerometerTidyData.txt and MeanFeatures.txt, which correspond, respectively, to the full tidy dataset and the means of all the variables by subject and activity
